This application was supposed to be a Twitter client for the iPad but was never finished.

A lot of this code was open-sourced code that I found a long time ago. I honestly don't remember / couldn't possibly link to all of them(but I'll probably try to do that another time). I was just using this to get the hang of coding a bit. Never planned to release this, but I decided I would.

If there are any problems feel free to email me(email is on the contact page of my website) if you have any issues with this and I'll gladly take it down.

I realize the name "Sparrow" is already the name of an OS X application. I didn't plan to release it with that name, or release it at all. Again, if you have issues, I'll gladly remove it!
